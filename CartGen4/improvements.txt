- JTAG connector requires +3V3 VCC
    - workaround: use +3V3 on expansion header (or take +3V3 from somewhere else)
    - solution: add it
- CSSPIN cannot be used when CFG0 = 0
    - see Q1
    - workaround: cut trace to flash CS in a manner that still has R5 connected as pullup to flash CS.
    use on of the USER pins on expansion header as temporary substitute.
    though, this modification makes the FPGA unable to load configuration from SPI, but so be it.
    - solution: ???
- pullup on TOE
    - recommended according to family datasheet
- increase decoupling capacitance of SD card
    - current 100n is way to little
    - shields typically use around 47u

quote from Lattice [Q1](https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Support/AnswerDatabase/2/0/4/2043):
    When using the LatticeXP2 device in dual boot mode, the FPGA continuously drives the CSSPIN high.

    The CSSPIN is considered a dual-purpose pin. However while the CFG0 pin = 0,
    controlling the dual-boot function, it will cause CSSPIN to be a dedicated configuration pin.
    CSSPIN will then drive high anytime it isn't trying to access the external SPI Flash device.
    Users desiring to use CSSPIN as a GPIO can make the CFG0 pin = 1 after configuration,
    this will return the CSSPIN pin to its default I/O behavior allowing GPIO use of the pin.

- Check reference designators for capacitors and resistors
    - e.g. schematic implies that C17 is SD card decoupling capacitor, but on the board C33 is closer
