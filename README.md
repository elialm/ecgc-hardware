Hardware documentation of the cartridge

This repo contains all relavant documentation of the cartridge hardware.
It currently only contains the 3th generation prototype schematic, but will include more:

- Legacy documentation
    - Old research reports
    - Old hardware reports
    - 1st and 2nd generation prototypes schematics

I'll add them when I get the change
