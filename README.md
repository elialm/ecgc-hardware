# ecgc-hardware

This repo contains all relevant documentation of the cartridge hardware.

The `legacy` directory contains legacy documentation.
This is just a collection of documents I made *waaaay* back when I was
just starting on the project.
It is included here just as an archive so I don't plan on updating anything.

The `CartGen3ProtoBoard` directory contains the schematics for the
first working prototype mentioned at [my website](https://efacdev.nl/posts/ecgc/20220601).
The photograph below is this prototype.

The `CartGen4` directory contains the schematics for the
next prototype.
I've included some renders of it below.

# Development tools

The tools used to make the schematics is [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).
It can be used to open the `*.kicad_pro` file to open the schematic
project.
